Changes in DAAG version 1.25.1-3
   o A number of URLs have been updated.
   o The bomregions2021 dataset updates the bomregions data 
     to 2021.
   o The dataset mdbAVtJtoD, with monthly Murray-Darling 
     basin data from January 1950 through to February 2022,
     has been added.
   
Changes in DAAG version 1.25

UPDATES
  o Vignettes sources are now R Markdown, with the
    format bookdown::html_document2 format combined
    with base_format: rmarkdown::html_vignette
    (This combination allows automatic numbering of
    figures, and cross-references.)
  o The `bomregions2018` dataset updates `bomregions`
    to include data through to 2018.  The updates
    `bomregions2012` and `bomregions2015` have been
    omitted.  A further column `avDMI` has been added, 
    holding values (from 1960 onwards) of the Annual 
    average (Indian) Dipole Mode Index.
  o Web links on what is now the `bomregions2018` help
    page have been updated.  The url in the DESCRIPTION 
    file now links to the development version of DAAG 
    on the gitlab site.
  o The `head.injury` dataset (which was a copy of the
    `headInjury` dataset) has been removed.
  o Help pages for related data sets have, in several
    cases, been combined.

                 Changes in DAAG version 1.24-1
                 
NEW FEATURES
  o The dataset coralPval, holding 3072 p-values from a gene
    expression array comparison between post- and pre-settlement
    coral larvae, has been added.
  o The dataset bomregions2015 (updates bomregions to include data 
    up to 2015) has been added.
  o The dataset lognihills, which replaces values in all 4 columns
    of nihills by log(values), has been added. Column names are 
    logdist, logclimb, logtime and logtimef.  
  o The generic function sumry(), with a method and print method
    for glm (but not other) objects, has been added.
  o The function DAAGtheme(), used to generate themes for use in 
    an intended 4th edition of Data Analysis and Graphics Using R,
    has been added.    
  o The functions CVlm() (alias cv.lm()), simulateLinear(), 
    qreference() and sampdist() all now return lattice objects.
    If the result is returned to the command line, the graph is
    plotted just as before.

BUG FIXES
  o A line that subtracted 1 from the bottom and top margins, 
    causing an error if the margin was already set to < 1, was
    removed from onetPermutation(), twot() and twotPermutation().
  o Code has been amended so that term labels ('term.labels') are
    given by attr(obj$terms, "term.labels").  The code now
    replaced expected to find 'term.labels' among the attributes 
    of the summary object; this would have failed starting 
    several R releases back.
  
                 Changes in DAAG version 1.21

NEW FEATURES
  o The dataset hurricNamed (deaths from Atlantic hurricanes,
    damage assessments, and other measures, from 1950 onwards) 
    has been added.
  o The dataset cps3 (a subset of cps10 has been added
  o The help file CVlm.Rd has been amended to give the correct 
    return value for CVlm() and cv.lm().
  o An enhanced version of overlapDensity()
    (an alias is  overlap.density()), as assumed by the code for
    Figure 13.3 on page 421 of the 3rd edition of "Data Analysis 
    and Graphics using R", has replaced the former version.
  
                 Changes in DAAG version 1.19

NEW FEATURES
  o The function align2D() has been added.  This finds the linear 
    transformation which, applied to one set of points in the (x, y) 
    plane, gives the best match in a least squares sense to a second 
    set of points.

BUG FIXES
  o The code for lmdiags() has been tidied.  
  o A bug in the function plotSimDiags() has been fixed.

                  Changes in DAAG version 1.18
NEW FEATURES
  o The functionality of lmdiags(), called from plotSimDiags(),
    has been slightly improved.


                  Changes in DAAG version 1.17

NEW FEATURES
   o There are improvements to the way that dependencies are handled.
   o The file simulate-reg.pdf has been replaced by two knitr vignettes --
     'Functions for Assessing the Sampling Properties of plot.lm()
      Regression Diagnostics', and '{Functions that Demonstrate the
      Sampling Properties of Variable Selection'.


                 Changes in DAAG version 1.16

NEW FEATURES

    o The function plotSimScat was added.  This plots either residuals
      or y-variable simulated values, against the x-variable from a
      straight line regression.
    o The datasets tomato and bomregions2013 were added.
    o A pdf file simulate-reg.pdf has been placed in the subdirectory
      inst/doc.  This demonstrates the use of the functions
      plotSimDiags, plotSimScat and bsnVaryNvar.

BUG FIX

    o The NAMESPACE file has been edited to ensure that the function
      layer, used in plotSimDiags and plotSimScat, is taken from the
      latticeExtra package.

                  Changes in DAAG version 1.15

NEW FEATURES

    o The function plotSimDiags was added.  This returns diagnostics
      for multiple sets of simulated data.

                  Changes in DAAG version 1.14

NEW FEATURES

    o The function CVlm (alias cv.lm) has been modified to allow
      multiple explanatory variables.  Predicted values can be
      subtracted off from the points that are shown.  If there is
      more than one explanatory variable, the lines that are shown
      for individual folds are approximations to the small points
      that show the fitted values for the respective fold.
      Arguments main (main title) and legend.pos have been added.

                  Changes in DAAG version 1.13

NEW FUNCTIONS

    o the function bsnOpt has been added - this finds the regression
      model that is optimal according to the stated criteria

    o the functions bestsetNoise, bestset.noise, bsnCV, bsnOpt, and
      bsnVaryNvar all allow the optional logical argument intercept.
      Except for bsnVaryNvar, the user now has the option to supply
      arguments X and y.

    o the function lmdiags and the generic function plotSimDiags with
      a method for lm models have been added.  The function takes as
      argument a model object, then returning a lattice graphics object
      or objects that show regression diagnostics for simulated data

BUG FIX

    o In the dataset possumsites, the first two column names have been
      corrected to "Longitude" and "Latitude".  The code under 'Examples'
      has been changed accordingly, so that the map that appears is
      the same as before.
