                  Changes in DAAG version 1.14

NEW FEATURES

    o The function CVlm (alias cv.lm) has been modified to allow
      multiple explanatory variables.  Predicted values can be
      subtracted off from the points that are shown.  If there is
      more than one explanatory variable, the lines that are shown
      for individual folds are approximations to the small points
      that show the fitted values for the respective fold.
      Arguments main (main title) and legend.pos have been added.

                  Changes in DAAG version 1.13

NEW FUNCTIONS

    o the function bsnOpt has been added - this finds the regression
      model that is optimal according to the stated criteria

    o the functions bestsetNoise, bestset.noise, bsnCV, bsnOpt, and
      bsnVaryNvar all allow the optional logical argument intercept.
      Except for bsnVaryNvar, the user now has the option to supply
      arguments X and y.

    o the function lmdiags and the generic function plotSimDiags with
      a method for lm models have been added.  The function takes as
      argument a model object, then returning a lattice graphics object
      or objects that show regression diagnostics for simulated data

BUG FIX

    o In the dataset possumsites, the first two column names have been
      corrected to "Longitude" and "Latitude".  The code under 'Examples'
      has been changed accordingly, so that the map that appears is
      the same as before.
